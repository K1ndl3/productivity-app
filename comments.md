initial thoughts
    -I want this project to the the culmination of what I learned about React for the past month (may1 - june1)
    -Although there were 2 whole weeks where I focused on studying for finals and machine learning and networks, I still consumed contents regularly about React
    -That is why I will record my first month of front-end webdev in this project
    -I have learned the basics and now am planning to combine all that I have learned into one project to solidify my understanding.

Project Goal
    -To build something with all the tools that I have learned throughout the pass month
    -Build a basic producivity app that will allow me to switch between the following functionalities: 
        1) todo list
        2) stop watch
        3) timer
    -The end goal is to learn and experience what It means to build something from scratch without using tutorial


"Think-along" of the project
    - was planning to use the sidebar componenent I had learned to keep track of different functionalities of the app
    - I ran into a problem where I think I should refactor the codebase already
        - since the app can be split into 2 main components, the sidebar and the main contents, I should create a wrapper for the 3 functionalities

    - So the main content will do the switching between the different functionalities
        - wow that means I have to adjust the css
        - the problem could have been prevented if I did not use App.jsx as my root element
        - Now i need to pass the classNames as the props for the components which are new concepts that I have not learned yet.
    - finished with the stop watch functionality of the app
        - I have some regrets about the styling of the stop watch
        - It honestly feels too rushed an too barebones. We may need to update the design later
    - starting on the Timer functionality now
